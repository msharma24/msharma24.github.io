title: How to get started with Resoto on AWS
---
# Introduction
[Resoto](https://resoto.com/about) is an [Open Source](https://github.com/someengineering/resoto)  CLI tool by [someengineering](https://some.engineering/)  that not only helps to simplify querying your entire cloud infrastructures inventory at 
the fingertips but also eases the mundane cloud janitor tasks such as finding and deleting the unused cloud resources across multiple AWS accounts which could be costing the business an arm and a leg and documenting cloud inventory for audit purposes in a pretty format.

# How does Resoto work?
Resoto indexes the infrastrcure resources of your AWS Account(s) by capturing the resource dependencies and maps out the entire
infrastrcure in a graph database, this graph database can then be easily queried using Resoto's powerful search sytanx.
