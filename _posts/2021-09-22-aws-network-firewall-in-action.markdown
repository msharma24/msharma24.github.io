title: AWS Network Firewall in action
---

AWS Network Firewall is a managed,  highly available network firewall service  for stateful inspection, intrusion detection and prevention , and web filtering to protect virtual networks on AWS and it  can be easily deployed and managed using Terraform , I took a deep dive experimenting with different [deployment architectures ](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/deployment-models-for-aws-network-firewall/) and its uses cases and have built the Distributed and Centralized Network Firewall Architecture using Terraform .

### You can find the project on my GitHub profile in the below URL -
